# Processed Data – 1-ns Comparative Simulations

This directory contains processed time-series data from the short (1-ns) comparative simulations of DUSP15 and DUSP7 described in Section 2.6.3.

Analyses include:
- Global backbone RMSD
- Catalytic-loop RMSD
- Per-residue RMSF
- Radius of gyration
- Motif SASA
- Intramolecular contacts
- Minimum distances
- Hydration metrics

For statistical comparisons reported in the manuscript, summary metrics were calculated over the final 200 ps (800–1000 ps) of each 1-ns trajectory to minimize potential equilibration effects.

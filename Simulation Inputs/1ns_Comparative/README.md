# 1-ns Comparative Molecular Dynamics Simulations

This directory contains input files used for the short (1-ns) comparative MD simulations described in Section 2.6.3 of the manuscript.

These simulations were performed under identical conditions for:

- DUSP15 (AlphaFold model)
- DUSP7 (AlphaFold model)

Simulation conditions:
- GROMACS 2024.2
- AMBER99SB-ILDN force field
- TIP3P water model
- 300 K, 1 bar
- 2 fs timestep
- 1 ns production run

These simulations were designed for direct dynamical comparison rather than extended equilibrium sampling.
